***PLEASE READ BEFORE VISITING:***

1. I tried my best to make the site responsive to any widescreen device. I designed it to work best on 1080p monitors, but it might look strange on devices with higher resolutions or aspect ratios other than 16:9. I know you like to make your powerpoints in 16k so that might be a problem.

2. The site is NOT designed for mobile. Things will break.

3. This site uses a hefty amount of JavaScript and animations, please make sure you view this site on a decent device so that the site doesn't lag too much. The average mac will do fine. 

4. The animations are pretty janky. I tried my best to debug them but they will glitch out if you scroll too fast, change the size of the window, scroll back up too fast, or if your computer tends to be glitchy. (Refreshing the tab usually fixes it)

5. Please view the site in a MODERN, COMMON browser on the latest version. I designed it in Firefox Developer Edition v127.0b7, so it will work well in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and probably Safari and Opera (though I haven't tested Safari nor Opera)

6. If the site is stuck on "Loading...", that means your connection sucks. The loading screen will only go away when EVERYTHING has finished loading (images, animations, external scripts, etc.), so try and get better wifi or use a VPN if you're having issues.

7. The website is permanent and public, you shouldn't have any access issues.

8. Lastly, I have a video that I'll provide you of what the site is supposed to look like if you're having any issues. Just message me on MCD and I'll give you a file.

Hope this clears up everything, please let me know if you have any other issues.
